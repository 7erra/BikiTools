# BIKI Tools
The BIKI (Bohemia Interactive Commnunity Wiki) is a Mediawiki based wiki about games from Bohemia Interactive, most notably the Arma series. The sqf language is the coding language of this game series. This tool was written to bring sqf scripts to the BIKI by automatically formatting the code. Current features are:
- Linking sqf commands
- Applying the {{cc|}} template for single line comments
- Adding a space in front of each line so it is rendered as code

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

Simply copy-paste your sqf code into the left window and copy the output on the right.

## Contributing
Test scripts are very welcome! This will require the default sqf file and the formatted version of it.
